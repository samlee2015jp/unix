Wait! Wait! Wait! What in the world is that dot? Everything was going fine until that dot showed up and now everything is confusing! We know what a dot-dot is but we!ve never seen a single dot.
It!s OK! It!s not as bad as it seems, I promise!
You know that dot-dot means the directory below us, or the room we came in through. Well, the sin- gle dot just means the current directory we are in, or, the room we are standing in right now. That!s it. No rocket science. Just plain here.
The example above is using both the dot-dot and the single dot. Picture grabbing something outside of your room and bringing it in. Or any action movie where someone gets dragged to safety before the boulder crushes them. That!s what this example is doing.
But using a single dot isn!t the only way to tell a spell you want something moved here. There are a few ways that mean the exact same thing. You could even call these spell synonyms.
